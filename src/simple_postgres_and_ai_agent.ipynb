The court concluded that the tenants could pursue claims under common law, breach of lease agreements, and the Washington Residential Landlord-Tenant Act. The ruling emphasized that landlords have obligations to maintain their properties in a manner that ensures tenant safety and health.\\n\\n2. **Rothweiler v. Clark County (2001)**: A homeowner’s claims against the county for failing to maintain the stormwater drainage system, which resulted in flooding, were dismissed based on the common enemy doctrine. The court noted that while landowners may divert surface water without liability, municipalities have a duty not to artificially collect and discharge water onto neighboring properties.\\n\\n3. **Pham v. Corbett (2013)**: In this case, tenants counterclaimed for relocation assistance under the Washington Tenant Act due to poor conditions in their unit, including water leaks and infestations. The court found in favor of the tenants, indicating that landlords are responsible for maintaining habitable living conditions, the breach of which can lead to damages.\\n\\n4. **Lian v. Stalick (2001)**: Here, the court recognized the implied warranty of habitability under the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act. A tenant sued for injuries resulting from unsafe living conditions, and the court concluded that the landlord's negligence in maintaining safe premises constituted a breach of that warranty.\\n\\n5. **Borden v. City of Olympia (2002)**: This case involved claims against the city for flooding resulting from increased stormwater discharged into a wetland and subsequently affecting the plaintiffs' property. The court held that a city could be liable if its actions led to artificially channeling water that resulted in flooding. \\n\\n6. **DiBlasi v. City of Seattle (1998)**: The court ruled that a municipality might be held liable for damages caused when it collects surface water on a street and discharges it onto another person's property in a manner different from the natural flow.\\n\\n7. **1515-1519 Lakeview Boulevard Condominium Ass'n v. Apartment Sales Corp. (2006)**: Homeowners filed suit against the city for permitting the construction of condominiums in a risk-prone area.
